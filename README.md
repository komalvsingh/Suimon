# 🚀 Suimon: A Decentralized Gaming & Governance Platform

> Play. Earn. Evolve. Govern — in a full-stack Web3 experience on Sui.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Web2 games offer fun but lack real ownership, transparency, and community governance. In Web3, current platforms either over-focus on DeFi or NFTs without providing engaging gameplay. There’s also friction in payments — wallet addresses are confusing and hard to share, making SUI transactions less intuitive.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To create a fully gamified Web3 platform where:

- Players **mint and evolve NFT avatars**
- Earn **EXP** through interactive games
- Make **frictionless payments** using human-readable usernames
- Participate in **DAO-based governance**

**Track:** 🕹️ Degen + Digital Payments  
**Users:** Gamers, NFT enthusiasts, and Web3 users seeking fun + financial freedom + control
