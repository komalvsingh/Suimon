# 🚀 Suimon: A Decentralized Gaming & Governance Platform

> A full-stack Web3 game and DAO platform powered by Sui blockchain and Move smart contracts.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Traditional web games and community governance systems are often centralized, lacking transparency, user ownership, and real-time interaction with game economies. There’s a gap in merging engaging gameplay with on-chain governance, ownership, and direct player participation in shaping the platform.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To build an interactive, decentralized platform where users can:

* Play blockchain-integrated games
* Participate in DAO governance
* Own and trade NFTs and in-game tokens
* Experience real-time, transparent blockchain interactions

**Target Users:**
Gamers, Web3 enthusiasts, and community members who value transparency, decentralization, and asset ownership.

Big thanks to the Sui ecosystem and open-source community!
